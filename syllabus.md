## Course Description

Introduction to the logical structure of computers,
including combinational and sequential logic, arithmetic, data paths,
CPU control, caches, and basic pipelining.

Office Hours:
* Mondays 1 - 2 PM
* Tuesdays 1 - 2 PM
* Fridays 1 - 2 PM

Zoom link for office hours:
[https://gvsu-edu.zoom.us/j/98637553783?pwd=RzJsazNrcDhFemFRTCtvN2xiblFnUT09](https://gvsu-edu.zoom.us/j/98637553783?pwd=RzJsazNrcDhFemFRTCtvN2xiblFnUT09)

The best way to contact me about the course is through
[Piazza](http://www.piazza.com/gvsu/winter2021/cis351section2/home).
I also regularly monitor the channel for this course on the unofficial
GVSU Discord,
though I will not post official announcements there and you are not responsible
for monitoring it.

I am always happy to schedule additional meetings outside of office hours,
and it is especially important with this class being online that you not
hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or concerns.
Because it is used elsewhere in the class,
my default assumption will be to set up a Zoom meeting,
but we can also chat on Discord, Google Meet, or other platforms if that is
more convenient for you.

## Course Meetings

The course lectures will be delivered asynchronously.
Synchronous meeting times will occur twice weekly:
* 4 - 4:50 PM Mondays (Virutal Classroom)
* 6 - 7:50 PM Wednesdays (Virtual Lab)

Zoom link for meetings and labs:
[https://gvsu-edu.zoom.us/j/91852767552?pwd=Z0NqMEhzdUxuTkszcTVORmJyTjhlQT09](https://gvsu-edu.zoom.us/j/91852767552?pwd=Z0NqMEhzdUxuTkszcTVORmJyTjhlQT09)
(note that this is *different* from the meeting link for office hours)

The lab sections on Wednesdays will begin with a brief introduction of the
week's lab followed by time to work with your partner and ask questions about
the lab.
The classroom section will be time for guided activities and questions about
lecture content.

## Course Objectives

After successful completion of this course, students will be able to:
* Construct simple combinatorial and sequential circuits.
* Trace the execution of an instruction in a simple CPU.
* Compare and contrast a pipelined CPU design with a single-cycle CPU design.
* Explain the benefits of the memory hierarchy.
* Explain how a particular cache configuration determines whether a memory
  access is a hit or a miss.
* Write code in an assembly language using standard programming constructs.

## Course Policies

* All assignments must be submitted to Prairielearn and are due at 11:59 PM EST
  on the due date.
  Some assignments will require drawing diagrams that must be uploaded to
  Prairielearn.
  If you do not have convenient access to a scanner,
  there are free document scanning apps available,
  such as the Google Drive app.
  I reserve the right to specify alternate submission cutoffs per assignment.
* No late assignments will be accepted.
  In cases of extreme emergency, such as an accident or illness resulting in
  hospitalization, please contact me and I will be reasonable.
* Homework assignments are to be completed individually unless directed otherwise.
  You may discuss the assignments with other students,
  but every student is expected to submit his or her own work.
  If you find yourself emailing code or written solutions to another student,
  even "for reference", you are violating this policy.
* Labs and projects are to be completed in pairs.
* Exams will not be rescheduled unless in extreme emergencies.
  If you have a question about this, please ask me.
  The exception to this is if an exam falls during a religious observence that
  would not allow you to participate in the exam.
  Rescheduling is perfectly fine in this case,
  but please let me know *as soon as possible* if this will be an issue.
* Attendance in this course is expected.
* This course is subject to the GVSU policies listed at
  http://www.gvsu.edu/coursepolicies/.

## Academic Honesty

In addition, students in this course are expected to adhere to the academic
honesty guidelines as set forth by the School of Computing and Information
Systems,
the details of which can be found at
[http://www.cis.gvsu.edu/Academics/Honesty/](http://www.cis.gvsu.edu/Academics/Honesty/).

Plagiarism is not tolerated and will result in a grade of 0 for the assignment
in question.
(Code or ideas taken from another source must be cited.)
Violations will be turned in to the Dean of Students and handled per university
